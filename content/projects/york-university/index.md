I was involved in many projects for York University. For two years in a row my
team developed the This Is My Time campaign. I also worked on the university
homepage, and the [Osgoode website](//osgoode.yorku.ca), which included an
[interactive timeline](//osgoode.yorku.ca/about/history) to represent their
history.
