I’ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to work across various systems under
the InVision brand. From the homepage to numerous marketing materials such as
the [DO UI Kit](//invisionapp.com/do), [Design Disruptors](//designdisruptors.com),
[Marketplace](//marketplace.invisionapp.com), and enterprise landing pages. I
also developed several email templates, which continue to be sent out to millions
of subscribers each week. I eventually transitioned to working on the core product
where I contributed to [Boards](//invisionapp.com/blog/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets),
[Inspect](//invisionapp.com/feature/inspect) for flat prototypes and document
viewer, and [V7](//invisionapp.com/blog/new-invision-v7).
