I’m Devin Schulz, a Graphic Designer and Senior Software Engineer in Ottawa, Canada. I share my software development journey with useful articles, tips, tricks, and the lessons I learn along the way to help you get unstuck or provide suggested approaches to particular problems.

I’m passionate about graphic design and web and mobile development. Because I started as a graphic designer, I was trained to think of the user’s experience first. As I transitioned to a more developer-centric role, I have carried that focus with me, and it comes through clearly in all of my projects.

I’m glad to have you along for the ride!
