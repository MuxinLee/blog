My name is Devin Schulz, a Graphic Designer and Senior Software Engineer
in Ottawa, Canada who is working remotely at InVision. I am looking to
share my journey with useful articles about Software Development. I hope
by sharing my tips and tricks, and lessons along the way I will help you
either get unstuck or provide suggested approaches to a particular problem.
My passion took off as soon as I began the Graphic Design program at
Algonquin College in 2009. I started my career as a designer of all things
but slowly transitioned to a more development centric role over time.
