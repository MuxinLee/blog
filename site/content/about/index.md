I’m Devin Schulz, a Senior Software Engineer and Graphic Designer in Ottawa, Canada. I take pride in my work; therefore I’ve decided to document my software development journey with useful articles, tips, tricks, and the lessons I learn along the way.

Since I started as a graphic designer, I was trained to think of the user's experience first. As I transitioned to a more developer-centric role, I have carried that focus with me, and it comes through clearly in all of my projects.

I hope the content I share can provide my readers with first-hand knowledge. I look forward to delivering suggestions and approaches that everyone can benefit from.

I’m happy to have you along for the ride!

— Devin
