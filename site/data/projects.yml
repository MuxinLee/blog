      Iâ€™ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to work across various systems
      under the InVision brand. From the homepage to numerous marketing materials such
      as the [DO UI Kit](//invisionapp.com/do), [Design
      Disruptors](//designdisruptors.com), [Marketplace](//marketplace.invisionapp.com), and enterprise landing pages. I also developed several email templates, which continue to be sent out to
      millions of subscribers each week. I eventually transitioned to working on the core
      product

      where I contributed to
      [Boards](//invisionapp.com/blog/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets),

      [Inspect](//invisionapp.com/feature/inspect) for flat prototypes and
      document

      viewer, and [V7](//invisionapp.com/blog/new-invision-v7).

      Having graduated from there, I was thrilled when I had the opportunity to
      help develop their homepage and a Wordpress theme. This allowed them to
      adopt a consistent look and feel.

      I was involved in many projects for York University. For two years in
      a row my team developed the This Is My Time campaign. I also worked on the
      university homepage, and the [Osgoode website](//osgoode.yorku.ca), which
